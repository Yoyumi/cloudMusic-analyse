Dewdrops shine brightly in the sunshine
Birds are singing a song in the blue sky
But you are in your dream
They are not on your mind

Unfortunately today is your work day
Tons of fellows are squeezing in the subway
But you are in your dream
Time's up, oh, time's up oh baby

Get up get up get up get up blahbala
Get up get up get up blahba
I know you don't wanna get up
But darling sweetie honey
Give up your struggling
You hear the ring

Get up get up get up get up blahbala
Get up get up get up blahba
But what are you doing
Wallowing in your dream
I ain't kidding
You hear the ring




There will be no time for you to brush your teeth
There will be no good for you only gambling
But you are in your dream
They are not on your mind

Are you rich or you don't need to have a job
The answer is "no" so get back to work
But you are in your dream
Time's up, oh, time's up oh baby

Get up get up get up get up blahbala
Get up get up get up blahba
I know you don't wanna get up
But darling sweetie honey
Give up your struggling
You hear the ring

Get up get up get up get up blahbala
Get up get up get up blahba
But what are you doing
Wallowing in your dream
I ain't kidding
You hear the ring




Get up get up get up get up blahbala
Get up get up get up blahba
I know you don't wanna get up
But darling sweetie honey
Give up your struggling
You hear the ring

Get up get up get up get up blahbala
Get up get up get up blahba
But what are you doing
Wallowing in your dream
I ain't kidding
You hear the ring ...

Get up get up get up get up blahbala
Get up get up get up blahba
If you don't wanna get up
Then you will get fired
Oh darling oh darling
You'll get fired
