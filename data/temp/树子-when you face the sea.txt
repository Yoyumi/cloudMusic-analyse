When you face the sea
You'll find
Something is rising in
It's rising in
When you face the sea
You'll find
Something is rising in
It's rising in
Woo~
When you face the sea
You'll find
Something is rising in
It's rising in
When you face the sea
You'll find
Something is rising in
It's rising in
When you walk alone at night
Something is rising in
It's rising in
When you face yourself in time
Something is rising in
Woo~
Rising in
It's all the same
Rising out
Hmm~
Rising in
It's all the same
Rising out
Hmm~
Woooooooo~~~
