And not fear
And rather in everywhere
In another room
You were not there
When I was giving into rope in another whore
And I'll be held on rather stay than move
when I'll be here into every old downstair
In everywhere and know
We're not the other pray
Gonna stop
Gonna stop
Before it's too late
Gonna stop oh
When you have changed and exchanged your soul to the sea
And not fear
And rather in everywhere
In another room
You were not there
When I was giving into rope
in another whore
And I'll be held on rather stay than move
when I'll be here into every old downstair
In everywhere and know
We're not the other pray
Gonna stop
Gonna stop
Before it's too late
Gonna stop oh
When you have changed and exchanged your soul to the sea
In other road they serve
Where am I no ti's in shout
In other way
In other road they serve
Where am I now ti's in prout
In other oven howin-tage
One two three four five and you get a tan
One two three four five and you get a tan
One two three four five and you get a tan
In another heaven you and I in heaven damn
And another heart in here in whether rough anywhere
Yeah gonna stop
Gonna stop
Before it's too late
Gonna stop oh
When you have changed not exchanged your soul to the sea
