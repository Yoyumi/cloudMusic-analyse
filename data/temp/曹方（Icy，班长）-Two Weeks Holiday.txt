I remember the last summer
you've been my hometown
for your holiday
two weeks holiday

The sun was burning all day
it can really turn your skin red
in two weeks holiday
haven't you see the
and haven't you see the

not far from us

you see
bamboo house
bamboo house
（in the foerest near by the river）
bamboo house
bamboo house
bamboo house
bamboo house
（in the foerest near by the river）

we're hand in hand in the dusk

like anyone who fall in love
in love in love in love

in love in love in love

haven't you see the

and haven't you see the

not far from us

you see
bamboo house
bamboo house
（in the foerest near by the river）
bamboo house
bamboo house
bamboo house
（in the foerest near by the river）
bamboo house

we're hand in hand in the dusk
like anyone who fall in love
in love in love in love

in love in love in love

I remember the last summer
you've been my hometown
for your holiday
two weeks holiday

The sun was burning all day
it can really turn your skin red
