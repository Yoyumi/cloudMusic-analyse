It's for Olga (Olga)
beautiful Russian girl…(beautiful Russian girl…）
Russian Girl
You're in my life so true
Russian Girl
You always seem so kind
When the time
When you are passing by
so I see your loneliness tonight
All the time
All the way I was looking for
Like the Painting and the piano from your home
Where is your tone
Where is your Mum and Dad and how are they?
I don't want to say hello Russian Girl
Russian Girl
You’re in my life so true
Russian Girl
You always seem so kind
When the time
When you are passing by
so I see your loneliness tonight
