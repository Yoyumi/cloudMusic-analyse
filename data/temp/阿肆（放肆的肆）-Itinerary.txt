Pyramid is napping in the sends
Eiffel Tower is sleeping near the Seine
But the landscape is somber without you
But the beauty is blue without you

Sailing a boat is what I'm waiting for
Riding a camel and I'm lying in your arms
See the sunrise and sunset
Oh my perfect traveling

Sailing a boat is what I'm waiting for
Riding a camel and I'm lying in your arms
See the sunrise and sunset
Oh my perfect itinerary
The Roman Arena is whirling for the fighters
Statue of Liberty is standing for the freedom
But the landscape is somber without you
But the feeling is blue without you

Sailing a boat is what I'm waiting for
Riding a camel and I'm lying in your arms
See the sunrise and sunset
Oh my perfect traveling
Sailing a boat is what I 'm waiting for
Riding a camel and I 'm lying in your arms
See the sunrise and sunset
Oh my perfect itinerary

Don't tell me
My plan is just a dream
You can't come with me
Life is short
It's our time to pack up and have fun
You know that
Sailing a boat is what I'm waiting for
Riding a camel and I'm lying in your arms
See the sunrise and sunset
Oh my perfect traveling

Sailing a boat is what I 'm waiting for
Riding a camel and I 'm lying in your arms
See the sunrise and sunset
Oh my perfect itinerary
