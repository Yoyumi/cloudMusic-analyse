有两个黑影在暮色的河边垂钓
Two black shadows are fishing by the river
他们注视着浮标在秘密地交谈轻声地窃笑
They are watching the buoy talking secretly andsnickering quietly
那些丢失的红萝卜被肮脏河水卷走了
Those missing carrots have been swept away by the dirty river
孩子徘徊在码头边不安地张望焦急地寻找
Children are wandering anxiously along the wharf
父亲遗留下来的水泥船
The concrete boat left by their father
依然被栓在岸边的枯树上
is still tied on the deadwood on shore
正进入梦乡它又梦见了自己
When it is falling asleep it dreams itself
又回到了海上随风荡漾
going back to the sea again and blowing in the wind
枯树它钢铁般的躯干正努力伸向河面
The iron trunk of the dead trees is trying to reach the river
它用尽了一生的时间却未能够着河面
It has used its whole life but still not able to reach it
在它渴死之前它又看见自己弯曲的倒影
Before dying of thirst it see its twisted reflections and
和屈辱的一生正印那河面
the humiliation of life which are printed on the river 
解开那缆绳撑着那船儿
Untie the rope drive the boat
去寻找那丢失的晚餐
Look for the missing dinner
问问那鱼儿鱼儿却跑了
Ask the fish but the fish swims away
自由的星空下机器人正带着镣铐满街奔跑
Under the starry sky of freedom a robot in chains is runing on ther street
暗淡的河面上漂满了马的头颅
There are full of the horse's heads floating on the dark river
回家的路上孩子你不必烦恼
On the way back home child don't worry
晚餐早已做好米饭煎鸡蛋
The dinner is ready there are fried eggs and rice
但亲人早已出门锅尚有余温
But families have gone out when the pot is still warm
