Last night in the dream I saw you again
baby they say I don't love you
You have me not just tonight
But you younger than me six years
If we can not marry you how to stand
baby I know although I didn't say
If we marry now and how to stand
baby don't wait for me in the night
I have not often think about them
but I how to forget the past
You don't believe me will not repeat
baby whatever whatever
I wanna be with you until I don't love you
baby people and people just a game
I'm willing to die for you if I love you
baby nothing else matters
If we can not marry you how to stand
baby I know although I didn't say
If we marry now and how to stand
baby don't wait for me in the night
I wanna be with you until I don't love you
baby people and people just a game
I'm willing to die for you if I love you
baby nothing else matters
baby 这都不叫事儿~李逼逼你湿了吗？
