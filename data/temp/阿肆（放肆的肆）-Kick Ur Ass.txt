So!
Pack yourself and get out of here
Stay away, oh leave me alone
Shut up now and get out of here
I'll never ever forgive you again
Don't tell me tell me tell me
Tell me you're sorry, indeed
I'll kick kick kick kick kick kick your ass
Don't tell me tell me tell me
All I see is misunderstanding
So
Move your ass and get out of here
I thank you for what you did to me
Shut up now and get out of here
I'll pray for you with all my heart
Don't tell me tell me tell me
Tell me you're sorry, indeed
I'll kick kick kick kick kick kick your ass
Don't tell me tell me tell me
All I see is misunderstanding
I'll kick kick kick your ass
Oh why? How can you still lie
You always make me cry
I wanna kick kick kick kick kick kick your ass
Oh why?! How can you still be alive
You always make me cry
I wanna kick kick kick kick kick kick your ass
Kick your ass
Kick your ass (now and then you know)
Kick your ass
Kick your ass
So!
Pack yourself and get out of here
Shut up!
Shut up
